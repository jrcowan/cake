This tool reminds you of birthdays that you have a tendency to forget about.

## WIP
This is a work-in-progress. The intention is to build a python project that some of my friends will be able to pick up easily and start contributing to. To help, I've created issues that they will be able to pick up. I do eventually want to transition this into a serverless architecture with AWS SAM, but for now I kept it simple with a console interface and data persistence via sqlite.
